<!-- 
This file is an example configuration file for regression.py. 

None of these tags are mandatory, and if nothing is provided the file will be
looked over and ignored.

If the -i tag is not set as an argument, images from the input directory will
be tested after the images provided in this file are.
By default the input directory will be ./input, however if the indir tag
is set, that value will become the new input directory. This directory must
have the required hash/keyword search files, and if -i is not set, this
will be the directory searched for images.

A CSV file will be created by default in the output directory. If the
global_csv tag is set in this file, a CSV file will be created or
appended to at that location. It must be given a specific file, not a directory.

Images can be added on any drive including network drives. If the image path
is incorrect, or if the image pointed to is an unsupported format, the regression
script will inform the user in an error message, but carry on without problems.
All paths given to the script have to be full paths from the root directoy.
NOTE: Some image formats can only be parsed by Autopsy using a Windows path
(i.e. X:\this\is\a\windows\path /this/is/not/a/windows/path)
It is up to the user to distinguish between the paths when adding to this file.

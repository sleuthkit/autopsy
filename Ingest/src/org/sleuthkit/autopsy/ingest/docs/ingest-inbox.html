            <p>
                The message inbox is used by Autopsy to provide real-time updates during ingest.
                To open the inbox, click on the yellow warning sign in the top/right corner of the Autopsy window.

            <p>
                Ingest modules are able to post messages when notable events occur, such as a keyword or hash database hit.
                If a module posts many similar messages in a short time span,
                the inbox will group those messages so that unique updates are not lost among the noise.
                When updates are posted with regard to a specific result or file, the message is linked to that file
                and the buttons in the top/right corner of the inbox can be used to browse to that data.

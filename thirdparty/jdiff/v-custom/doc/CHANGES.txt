Released
--------

1.1.1 - 3rd October 2008

Patch for 1990278 (the xml report doesn't escape & in type names) from
owenomalley included.

1.1.0 - 3rd September 2007

Support for generics (new with J2SE1.5) added. Still need to add
support for enums, varargs and annotations.

#1604749 fixed - Scanning only specified files is broken

Merged patch from Stefan Aust so you can pass a "source" argument to the Ant
task to specify the language version, e.g. for dealing with asserts.

1.0.10 - 31st May 2004

#954228 Feature request from Kohsuke Kawaguchi (and 2 years ago from
 Steve Loughran!) to add a custom Ant Task for JDiff.

#875516 Some HTML elements in user comments were being processed incorrectly. 
Thanks to Jojo Dijamco for pointing this bug out.

#875470 @link tags were not expanded in user comments. 
#877437 Other issues with @link in user comments.
Many thanks to Brian Duff for these bugs and their fixes.

#815039 If the only changes in a class are in native or sync method changes, 
and showAllChanges is not used, then no change has occurred. Thanks to 
C. Le Goff for finding this bug and providing the fix.

#872344 JDiff was using a relative URI for XMLReader.parse(). This
made it hard to use an XML parser other than Xerces. Thanks to Brian
Duff for finding this bug and providing the fix.

Tested with j2sdk1.5.0 beta1, released with examples built by JDK1.4.2.

Updated copyright notices to 2004.

1.0.9 - 19th June 2003
Darren Carlton <darren at bea.com> pointed out that Javadoc
package.html files may, in fact, be full HTML documents.
This fix only solves the issue for package.html
HTML, not the general issue of HTML comments.

Jan Rueten-Budde <jan at rueten-budde.de> noted that the -excludetag
option was not working for package-level documentation block,
and that its documentation needed improvement.

Jan also observed that only the simple names, not the fully-qualified names of 
exceptions were being saved and compared. This meant that if an exception 
changed class, but kept the same name, the change was not detected. The 
qualified name is now used. See the troubleshooting section for how to use the 
simple names if the entries in reports are too large.

Tested with J2SE1.4.1.
Minor HTML formatting fixes.

Changed the default behaviour to not show changes in native and sychronized
modifiers. Added the -showallchanges to show changes in these modifiers. Thanks
go to Jesse Glick for this.

Bug 757376. Now copes with body elements with attributes in package.htm[l] 

1.0.8 - 31st July 2002
Completed feature request 543260 (add an option to emit XML in another 
directory) - thanks to Martin Bosak for these changes.
Fixed bug 587072 (InvocationTargetException doing diff) by adding extra string 
length checks when determining the first sentence of a comment.
Added a top-level ANT build file.

1.0.7 - June 24th 2002
Completed feature request 561922 to make JDiff JAXP compliant. This
change required xerces.jar to be added to the -docletpath values in
build scripts.
Fixed feature request 510307 and bug 517383: duplicate comment
ids. This only occurred when package-level documentation existed
and also the last file scanned was an interface. 
Fixed bug where comments for interfaces did not have @link tags
expanded.
Fixed bug 547422 by adding a note about other ANT Javadoc task
properties to the example build.xml file.
Removed some left-over Windows variable notation from csh files (patch
565921) and made the ANT build.xml files less platform-dependent.
Added more comments in the ANT build.xml files about the -javadocold
and -javadocnew arguments, and how to make sure that links to shipped Javadoc
documentation are relative, and not absolute.
Created KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.txt file to document issues which are
unlikely to be fixed soon.
Renamed JDIFF_INSTALL local variable to JDIFF_HOME in Jdiff build scripts,
since this seems to be more like ANT (patch 566022).

1.0.6 - January 9th 2002
Fixed bug 494135 (Compare classes which have no package).
Fixed bug 494970 (HTML strike element in the index was not closed when
fields of the same name were deleted from different classes), and made
a minor change to the index entries for fields with the same names.
Fixed a bug where not specifying -javadocold could lead to a broken link
in removed constructor text, and in the links to old package descriptions.

Added feature request 494058, an ANT 1.4.1 build file for the JDiff
examples, using the ANT Javadoc task - thanks to Douglas Bullard.
Added feature request 493367 (Ability to use other XML parsers) -
thanks to Vladislav Protasov for suggesting this.

Changed the default to be to *not* report changes in documentation. Use the
-docchanges to enable this option.
Added the ability to run jdiff.JDiff as a Java application called from a
batch file or shell script, which makes the necessary calls to Javadoc
using a single XML configuration file.
Added better detection of a method or field moving to or from a parent
class.
Added checking for changes in field values (the @value tag in J2SE1.4).
Changed the link to existing Javadoc link to the specific package or class.
Improved the algorithm used to find the summary sentence in documentation.
Added the -windowtitle and -doctitle options to make it easier to
uniquely identify different reports about the same APIs.
Added ability to validate the XML generated by JDiff.
Changed the XML representation of <implements> to be a single element.
Options to display the version and usage of JDiff added.
More cleaning up of the generated HTML.

1.0.5 - November 17th 2001
Fixed bug 482207 (Unable to run javadiff behind a firewall) by adding
the -baseURI option.
Fixed bug 482194 (Missing support for iso-8859-1 charset), which also
caused the option -allsentences to be renamed -firstsentence and
reversed in sense.
Added links to previous and next packages and classes.
Added top-level index file for all documentation differences.
Added links from documentation difference pages to classes, in
addition to the existing links to constructors, methods and fields.
Added META tags to generated HTML.
Removed unnecessary use of xhtml1-transitional.dtd, since all comment
text is in CDATA elements.
Used http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ to clean up the generated HTML.
Corrected somes uses of JDK/J2SE and the capitalization of Javadoc.

1.0.4 - November 8th 2001
Added feature request 472605 with the documentation differences page,
which shows specific changes in Javadoc documentation as inserts and deletes.
Improved the end of sentence checking in doc blocks.
Added graphics of the statistics histograms.

1.0.3 - November 2nd 2001
Fixed bugs in tracking package and class-level documentation changes.
Fixed bugs in tracking documentation changes at the constructor,
method and field level.

==== Bug fixes ====
* Avoid erroneous error when writing 512 bytes on hard disk using 4k sector
* FAT, NTFS: avoid NULL pointer dereference if localtime() returns NULL. Thanks to Graham Sutherland for reporting this bug.

=== PhotoRec & QPhotoRec ===
QPhotoRec is a Graphical User Interface (Qt based GUI) version of PhotoRec. More user friendly, it recognizes the same file formats.

PhotoRec remains recommended for advanced users, it can stop a recovery and resume it later, it recovers more fragmented files when brute-force technology is enabled and expert mode is available.

==== Improvements ====
* Reduced false positives for more than 80 file formats.
* .gif: fix filesize detection
* .flv: add Flash filesize detection
* .mpg: detect filesize for MPEG
* .ra: detect filesize for RealAudio3
* Improved algorithm to deal with data fragmentation resulting in a general speed increased
* Speedup brute-force mode. Brute-force mode can recover more fragmented files, but it's still slow and not 100% reliable. You can enable it in PhotoRec Options menu.

New file formats recovered by PhotoRec:
* .3dm: Rhino / openNURBS
* .ari: ARRI Raw Video
* .camrec: Camtasia Studio
* .dad: Micae DVR
* .dcm: Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)

* The log file generated by the Windows version (cygwin) reports bad sectors in a more readable fashion, example
<code>ReadFile Data error (cyclic redundancy check)</code>.
* As openssl isn't used, don't link with this cryptographic library (Debian tries to avoid mixing GPL code and openssl)

=== TestDisk ===
==== Improvements ====
* <code>testdisk /list</code> now displays the disk model, serial number, firmware version and hpa or dco presence if detected
* Recover WBFS (Wii Backup File System) partition
* Make FAT RebuildBS works when there is a single FAT table
* Interface: Display the partition table type if autodetected

6.11
TestDisk & PhotoRec 6.11 should use less CPU.
This new TestDisk version can undelete files for NTFS filesystem and recover deleted exFAT and ext4.
PhotoRec
- Performance improvement when scanning for numerous file type
- Fix several bugs including an endless loop, several memory leaks and several out-of-bound memory access
- 50 file formats have been added

6.10
TestDisk & PhotoRec 6.10 comes with severals improvements:
- Report disk manufacturer and model under Windows and Linux (Only Linux was
  supported in 6.9)
- Under Linux, /dev/mapper/* and /dev/md? are now listed with the harddisks.
- Now both OS and compiler versions are recorded in the log file.

This new TestDisk version can
- undelete files and directories for FAT filesystem,
- undelete files for ext2 filesystem,
- copy files from ext2/ext3 partitions. These feature was already available
  for FAT and NTFS.

PhotoRec
- Load and save FileOpts settings: remember which file types to recover
- For JPEG files, extract the time/date from Exif header and set the
  file time. It's now easier to sort the recovered jpg.
- PhotoRec can now identify and recover 38 additional file formats.

6.9
TestDisk & PhotoRec 6.9 comes with numerous improvements:
- They are compatible with ntfsprogs 2.0, the latest library version for
accessing NTFS partitions, e2fsprogs 1.40.6, the latest library for accessing
 ext2/ext3 partitions.
- EFI GUID Partition Table is now supported. EFI GPT is mainly used on Itanium,
MacBook and Mac Pro.
- Both utilities can use sudo if the user is not root, this functionnality will
be enabled for at least MacOSX, so users won't have to go into a command line.
- Improved Windows disk support, most internal USB card reader should now work.
- Disk model (ie. ATA ST3120026AS, _NEC DVD_RW ND-4550A...) are now reported
under Linux.

TestDisk
- New file system support has been added: encrypted LUKS, Mac HFSX, Linux Raid
md 1.0/1.1/1.2 (0.9 was already supported).
- It displays unicode filenames correctly, and can handle unicode filesnames
 while copying files from an NTFS partition when supported by the underlying
 libraries.
- It's now possible to copy files from a lost FAT partition found by TestDisk
 (Already possible for NTFS).
- In the Advanced menu, TestDisk can create a raw/dd-like image of a partition.

PhotoRec
- For ext2/ext3 file systems, PhotoRec 6.9 can search in the whole space or in
unallocated space only. This feature was already available for FAT and NTFS
filesystem.
- It has better session support which allows a recovery to be stopped and
restarted later.
- New file formats are supported: Acronis True Image .TIB, AutoCAD's .DWG and
PowerTab .PTB, Cineon image file/SMTPE DPX .DPX, Comic Life .comicdoc, HP
Photosmart Photo Printing Album .albm, KeepAssX .KDB, Maya .MB and .MP,
Microsoft OneNOte .one file, Microsoft Visual Studio Resource file .RES,

Explorer index.dat, Macintosh Picture .pct, SunPCI Disk Image,XBOX GTA San
Andreas Save File, Final Cut Pro .fcp and Digital Speech Standard .dss.

6.8
Version 6.8 is mainly a bugfix but some small improvements has been made to
both TestDisk and PhotoRec:
- Partition type is now autodetected.
- TestDisk and PhotoRec can now be used under screen, the screen manager with
VT100/ANSI terminal emulation.

TestDisk
HFS detection has been improved to avoid false positive.
TestDisk logs potential NTFS partition location from MFT & MFTMirr location
while rebuilding NTFS boot sector.

PhotoRec
Some important bugfixes (false positive problem, implementation bugs) have been
made in PhotoRec 6.8. JPG bruteforce recovery has been improved a little bit,
you can use it to recover more fragmented jpeg but it's very time consuming and
not 100% reliable, so it's still disabled by default.
.7z, .cab, .rar and .tar recovery have been improved, .dta and .spss file
formats have been added.

6.7
Both utilities are faster than previous versions: a better disk caching is
used in PhotoRec, a better way to handle the sector to scan is used in
TestDisk. Windows version of TestDisk and PhotoRec doesn't use
pread()/pwrite() cygwin implementation (A bug seems present).

TestDisk
TestDisk 6.7 handles partition created under Microsoft Vista.
Traditionally partitions were created on cylinder boundaries. Under Vista,
they are now independent of the disk geometry: partitions are aligned to 1
MB boundary, TestDisk now handles that. It also fixes how the advanced
menu works.

PhotoRec
PhotoRec 6.7 uses less CPU. It also adds support for 3ds max, Archive
.ace, CD Audio .cda, FastTrackerII Extended Module .xm, Linux archive .a,
Linux/Unix ELF binary, Mac OS .emlx mail format, Macomedia Compressed
Flash .swc, Macromedia .flv, Macromedia Freehand 5 (.fh5) & 10 (.fh10) and

.cab, MSOffice "Open" XML .docx, .pptx, .xlsx, MS executable (PE), MS
Windows Metafile .wmf, NJStar .njx, Quickbooks .qbb and .qbw, Real Audio
.rm, registry config file .reg, RPM package .rpm, Windows registry header
detection and Event Log .evt

6.6
General Improvements
- Encase Expert Witness Compression Format is now supported, so Computer
Forensic Experts can use TestDisk and PhotoRec more easily.
- Under new Vista OS, harddisks are now being reported again.
TestDisk
- If LBA48 support seems missing (HD bigger than 130 GB not supported by
the OS), TestDisk will warn the user. This problem is common when a user
reinstalls his OS and forgets to install the latest service patches.
- NTFS: TestDisk should be able to list files from NTFS partitions even if
some filesystem corruption has occurred; more importantly, it will allow
the user to copy whatever file data it can as well.
- FAT: Improved heuristics to find the first FAT area during boot sector
rebuild.
PhotoRec
- A new method for handling fragmented data is now used, making recovery
more reliable and faster.
- PhotoRec can be set to search for files in FAT16/FAT32 unallocated space
only; which avoids wasting time recovering files that are still
accessible, making the recovery of 'lost files' much faster and more
efficient.
- New file formats have been added: .3g2 (Mov video family), .aif Apple
Audio, .all .cpr Cubase Song, .blend Blender, .cam Casio QV Digital Camera
Image, .flac Free Lossless Audio Codec, .mdf Microsoft SQL, .swf
Macromedia Flash and .vcf VCard (not confused with .txt anymore)

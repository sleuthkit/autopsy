plaso (Plaso Langar Að Safna Öllu) - super timeline all the things

In short, plaso is a Python-based backend engine for the tool log2timeline.

A longer version:

log2timeline is a tool designed to extract timestamps from various files found
on a typical computer system(s) and aggregate them.

The initial purpose of plaso was to collect all timestamped events of interest
on a computer system and have them aggregated in a single place for computer
forensic analysis (aka Super Timeline).

However plaso has become a framework that supports:
* adding new parsers or parsing plug-ins;
* adding new analysis plug-ins;
* writing one-off scripts to automate repetitive tasks in computer forensic
  analysis or equivalent.

And is moving to support:
* adding new general purpose parses/plugins that may not have timestamps
  associated to them;
* adding more analysis context;
* tagging events;
* allowing more targeted approach to the collection/parsing.

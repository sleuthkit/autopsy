/**
  * Basic interface for CSS error handlers.
  *
  * <p>If a CSS application needs to implement customized error
  * handling, it must implement this interface and then register an
  * instance with the CSS parser using the parser's setErrorHandler
  * method.  The parser will then report all errors and warnings
  * through this interface.</p>
  *
  * <p> The parser shall use this interface instead of throwing an
  * exception: it is up to the application whether to throw an
  * exception for different types of errors and warnings.  Note,
  * however, that there is no requirement that the parser continue to
  * provide useful information after a call to fatalError (in other
  * words, a CSS driver class could catch an exception and report a
  * fatalError).</p>
  *
  * <p>The HandlerBase class provides a default implementation of this
  * interface, ignoring warnings and recoverable errors and throwing a
  * SAXParseException for fatal errors.  An application may extend
  * that class rather than implementing the complete interface
  * itself.</p>

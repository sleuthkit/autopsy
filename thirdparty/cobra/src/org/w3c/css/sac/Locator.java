/**
 * Interface for associating a CSS event with a document location.
 *
 * <p>If a SAX parser provides location information to the SAX
 * application, it does so by implementing this interface and then
 * passing an instance to the application using the document
 * handler's setDocumentLocator method.  The application can use the
 * object to obtain the location of any other document handler event
 * in the CSS source document.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the results returned by the object will be valid only
 * during the scope of each document handler method: the application
 * will receive unpredictable results if it attempts to use the
 * locator at any other time.</p>
 *
 * <p>CSS parsers are not required to supply a locator, but they are
 * very strong encouraged to do so.  If the parser supplies a
 * locator, it must do so before reporting any other document events.
 * If no locator has been set by the time the application receives
 * the startDocument event, the application should assume that a
 * locator is not available.</p>

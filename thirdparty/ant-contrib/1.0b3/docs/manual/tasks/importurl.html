    <title>Ant-contrib Tasks: Importurl</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Importurl</h1>

    <p>The Importurl task will download a file, and import it's contents into the
       current project.  The file can be in the form of a standard ant .xml project
       file, or a .jar/.zip file.
    </p>
    <p>In the case of an .xml file, the file is downloaded, and imported as
       is.  In this case, the file itself is the only thing downloaded (ie.
       no corresponding .properties files, or other build files are downloaded).
    </p>
    <p>In the case of a .jar/.zip file, the file is downloaded and then
       decompressed.  After decompression, the file 'build.xml' at the root
       level of the jar is imported. By importing a .jar/.zip file, one can package additional resources along with
       the build.xml file.  However, you must be careful how you refer to these resources.
       The build.xml file must follow the same rules as any other file imported with the
       &lt;import&gt; task, in that references relative to the build.xml file must be
       made with the property:
           ant.file.&lt;projectname&gt;
       where &lt;projectname&gt; is the name of the project being imported, as specified
       in the project tag.  Example:
    </p>
    
    <pre>    
    <code>
        &lt;project name="common"&gt;
            &lt;basedir property="ant.dir.common" file="${ant.file.common}" /&gt;
            &lt;property file="${ant.dir.common}/build.properties" /&gt;
        &lt;/project&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>    

    <p>
       This task should be compatible with older versions of ant, but has only been
       tested with Ant 1.6.x.  The underlying implementation is done using the
       <a href="http://jayasoft.org/ivy">Ivy</a> dependency resolver software,
       and thus, it needs available to the same classloader that loads this task.

Keyword Search module:
- Slack space of files is not added to the index and therefore will
not be searched.
- Files larger than 100MB AND that are file types that are supported
by Tika (word docs, PDF, HTML, JPEG, etc.) are now added to the index as fully extracted text.
However, due to memory limitations of certain parsers, if full text extraction fails, 
only strings extracted from the large file will be added to the index.

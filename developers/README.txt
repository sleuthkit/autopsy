Common NetBeans IDE settings for the Autopsy project are stored here. 
All contributors are kindly asked to use these settings.

1. To make Java code formatting (pretty-printing) settings, select Tools, 
Options, Editor tab, Formatting tab. Push the Import... button to pop up the
Select Options to Import dialog. Push the Browse... button to pop up a file
chooser. Select ~\autopsy\developers\netbeans_ide_formatting_settings.zip.
NetBeans IDE will require a restart for the settings to take effect. Formatting
can be done by selecting Source, Format (Alt + Shift + F).
2. To make Java code hygiene hints (lint) settings, copy the entire contents of
~\autopsy\developers\netbeans_ide_java_hint_settings to the hint/default 
subdirectory of your user settings directory for the IDE. For Windows, this is 
~\AppData\Roaming\NetBeans\8.2\config\Preferences\org\netbeans\modules\java\hints
\default. Restart the IDE.

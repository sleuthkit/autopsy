This document outlines how to run a packaged version of Autopsy on Linux or OS X.  It does not cover how to compile it from source or the Windows installer. 


* Prerequisites *

The following need to be done at least once. They do not need to be repeated for each Autopsy release.

- Install testdisk for photorec functionality
-- Linux:  % sudo apt-get install testdisk
-- OS X: % brew install testdisk

- Install a Java 8 JRE and JavaFX 8 and set JAVA_HOME. 
-- Linux: Any Java 8 version of OpenJDK/OpenJFX distribution should suffice. The following instructions use the Zulu Community distribution.
    1. Download a 64 bit Java 8 JRE for your specific platform from https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community
    2. Install the JRE. e.g. % sudo apt install ./zulu8.40.0.25-ca-jre8.0.222-linux_amd64.deb
    3. Download a 64 bit Java 8 JavaFX for your specific platform from the same location.
    4. Extract the contents of the JavaFX archive into the folder where the JRE was installed.
        e.g. % sudo tar xzf ~/Downloads/zulu8.40.0.25-ca-fx-jre8.0.222-linux_x64.tar.gz -C /usr/lib/jvm/zre-8-amd64 --strip-components=1

    NOTE: You may need to log out and back in again after setting JAVA_HOME before the Autopsy 
          unix_setup.sh script can see the value. 

-- OS X: Any Java 8 version of OpenJDK/OpenJFX distribution should suffice.
    1. Install a 64 bit Java 8 JRE.
        % brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk
        % brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
    2. Download a 64 bit Java 8 JavaFX for macOS from https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community
    3. Extract the contents of the JavaFX archive into the folder where the JRE was installed.
        e.g.  % sudo tar xf ~/Downloads/zulu8.40.0.25-ca-fx-jre8.0.222-macosx_x64.tar.gz -C /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home--strip-components=1
    4. Confirm Java 8 is being found by running 'java -version'
    5. Set JAVA_HOME environment variable to location of JRE installation.

* Install The Sleuth Kit Java Bindings *

Autopsy depends on a specific version of The Sleuth Kit.  You need the Java libraries of The Sleuth Kit installed, which is not part of all packages. 

- Linux: Install the sleuthkit-java.deb file that you can download from github.com/sleuthkit/sleuthkit/releases.  This will install libewf, etc. 
-- % sudo apt install ./sleuthkit-java_4.6.0-1_amd64.deb

- OS X: Install The Sleuth Kit from brew.  
-- % brew install sleuthkit


* Install Autopsy *

- Extract the contents of the Autopsy ZIP file to a folder.
- Open a terminal and cd into the Autopsy folder. 
- Run the unix_setup.sh script to configure Autopsy
  % sh unix_setup.sh


* Running Autopsy *

- In a terminal, change to the ‘bin’ directory in the Autopsy folder.
- Run Autopsy
  % ./autopsy

* Limitations (Updated May 2018) * 
- Timeline does not work on OS X
- Video thumbnails are not generated (need to get a consistent version of OpenCV)
- VHD and VMDK files not supported on OS X

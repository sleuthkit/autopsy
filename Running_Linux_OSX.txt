This document outlines how to run a packaged version of Autopsy on Linux or OS X.  It does not cover how to compile it from source or the Windows installer. 


* Prerequisites *

The following need to be done at least once. They do not need to be repeated for each Autopsy release.

- Install testdisk for photorec functionality
-- Linux:  % sudo apt-get install testdisk
-- OS X: % brew install testdisk

- Install Oracle Java and set JAVA_HOME. 
-- Linux: Use the instructions here: https://medium.com/coderscorner/installing-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-16-10-845507b13343
          NOTE: You may need to log out and back in again after setting JAVA_HOME before the Autopsy 
          unix_setup.sh script can see the value. 
-- OS X: Use The Oracle website: https://www.java.com/
         Set JAVA_HOME with something like: export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home` in .bash_profile


* Install The Sleuth Kit Java Bindings *

Autopsy depends on a specific version of The Sleuth Kit.  You need the Java libraries of The Sleuth Kit installed, which is not part of all packages. 

- Linux: Install the sleuthkit-java.deb file that you can download from github.com/sleuthkit/sleuthkit/releases.  This will install libewf, etc. 
-- % sudo apt install ./sleuthkit-java_4.6.0-1_amd64.deb

- OS X: Install The Sleuth Kit from brew.  
-- % brew install sleuthkit --with-jni --with-libewf --with-afflib


* Install Autopsy *

- Extract the contents of the Autopsy ZIP file to a folder.
- Open a terminal and cd into the Autopsy folder. 
- Run the unix_setup.sh script to configure Autopsy
  % sh unix_setup.sh


* Running Autopsy *

- In a terminal, change to the ‘bin’ directory in the Autopsy folder.
- Run Autopsy
  % ./autopsy

* Limitations (Updated May 2018) * 
- Timeline does not work on OS X
- Video thumbnails are not generated (need to get a consistent version of OpenCV)
- VHD and VMDK files not supported on OS X

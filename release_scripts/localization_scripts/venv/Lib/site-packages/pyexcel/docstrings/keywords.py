CSV_PARAMS = """
**Parameters related to csv file format**

for csv, `fmtparams <https://docs.python.org/release/3.1.5/
library/csv.html#dialects-and-formatting-parameters>`_ are accepted

delimiter :
    field separator

lineterminator :
    line terminator

encoding:
    csv specific. Specify the file encoding the csv file. For example:
    encoding='latin1'. Especially, encoding='utf-8-sig' would add utf 8
    bom header if used in renderer, or would parse a csv with utf brom header
    used in parser.

escapechar :
    A one-character string used by the writer to escape the
    delimiter if quoting is set to QUOTE_NONE and the quotechar if
    doublequote is False.

quotechar :
    A one-character string used to quote fields containing special
    characters, such as the delimiter or quotechar, or which
    contain new-line characters. It defaults to '"'

quoting :
    Controls when quotes should be generated by the writer and
    recognised by the reader. It can take on any of the QUOTE_*
    constants (see section Module Contents) and defaults to QUOTE_MINIMAL.

skipinitialspace :
    When True, whitespace immediately following the delimiter is ignored.
    The default is False.

pep_0515_off :
    When True in python version 3.6, PEP-0515 is turned on.
    The default is False

"""

XLRD_PARAMS = """
**Parameters related to xls file format:**
    Please note the following parameters apply to pyexcel-xls.
    more details can be found in :func:`xlrd.open_workbook`

logfile:
    An open file to which messages and diagnostics are written.

verbosity:
    Increases the volume of trace material written to the logfile.

use_mmap:
    Whether to use the mmap module is determined heuristically.
    Use this arg to override the result.

    Current heuristic: mmap is used if it exists.

encoding_override:
     Used to overcome missing or bad codepage information
     in older-version files.

formatting_info:
     The default is False, which saves memory.

     When True, formatting information will be read from the spreadsheet
     file. This provides all cells, including empty and blank cells.
     Formatting information is available for each cell.

ragged_rows:
     The default of False means all rows are padded out with empty
     cells so that all rows have the same size as found in ncols.

     True means that there are no empty cells at the ends of rows. This
     can result in substantial memory savings if rows are of widely
     varying sizes. See also the row_len() method.

**Examples on start_row, start_column**

.. testcode::
   :hide:

    >>> import sys
    >>> if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
    ...     from StringIO import StringIO
    ... else:
    ...     from io import StringIO
    >>> from pyexcel_io._compact import OrderedDict

Let's assume the following file is a huge csv file:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import datetime
   >>> import pyexcel as pe
   >>> data = [
   ...     [1, 21, 31],
   ...     [2, 22, 32],
   ...     [3, 23, 33],
   ...     [4, 24, 34],
   ...     [5, 25, 35],
   ...     [6, 26, 36]
   ... ]
   >>> pe.save_as(array=data, dest_file_name="your_file.csv")

And let's pretend to read partial data:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> pe.get_sheet(file_name="your_file.csv", start_row=2, row_limit=3)
   your_file.csv:
   +---+----+----+
   | 3 | 23 | 33 |
   +---+----+----+
   | 4 | 24 | 34 |
   +---+----+----+
   | 5 | 25 | 35 |
   +---+----+----+

And you could as well do the same for columns:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> pe.get_sheet(file_name="your_file.csv", start_column=1, column_limit=2)
   your_file.csv:
   +----+----+
   | 21 | 31 |
   +----+----+
   | 22 | 32 |
   +----+----+
   | 23 | 33 |
   +----+----+
   | 24 | 34 |
   +----+----+
   | 25 | 35 |
   +----+----+
   | 26 | 36 |
   +----+----+

Obvious, you could do both at the same time:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> pe.get_sheet(file_name="your_file.csv",
   ...     start_row=2, row_limit=3,
   ...     start_column=1, column_limit=2)
   your_file.csv:
   +----+----+
   | 23 | 33 |
   +----+----+
   | 24 | 34 |
   +----+----+
   | 25 | 35 |
   +----+----+


The pagination support is available across all pyexcel plugins.

.. note::

   No column pagination support for query sets as data source.


*Formatting while transcoding a big data file*

If you are transcoding a big data set, conventional formatting method would not
help unless a on-demand free RAM is available. However, there is a way to
minimize the memory footprint of pyexcel while the formatting is performed.

Let's continue from previous example. Suppose we want to transcode
"your_file.csv" to "your_file.xls" but increase each element by 1.

What we can do is to define a row renderer function as the following:

   >>> def increment_by_one(row):
   ...     for element in row:
   ...         yield element + 1

Then pass it onto save_as function using row_renderer:

   >>> pe.isave_as(file_name="your_file.csv",
   ...             row_renderer=increment_by_one,
   ...             dest_file_name="your_file.xlsx")


.. note::

   If the data content is from a generator, isave_as has to be used.

We can verify if it was done correctly:

   >>> pe.get_sheet(file_name="your_file.xlsx")
   your_file.csv:
   +---+----+----+
   | 2 | 22 | 32 |
   +---+----+----+
   | 3 | 23 | 33 |
   +---+----+----+
   | 4 | 24 | 34 |
   +---+----+----+
   | 5 | 25 | 35 |
   +---+----+----+
   | 6 | 26 | 36 |
   +---+----+----+
   | 7 | 27 | 37 |
   +---+----+----+

.. testcode::
   :hide:

    >>> import os
    >>> os.unlink("your_file.csv")
    >>> os.unlink("your_file.xlsx")

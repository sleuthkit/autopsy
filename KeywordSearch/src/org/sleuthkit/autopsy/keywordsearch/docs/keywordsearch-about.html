        <h2>Keyword Search</h2>
        <p>
            Autopsy ships a keyword search module, which provides the <a href="nbdocs:/org/sleuthkit/autopsy/ingest/docs/ingest-about.html">ingest capability</a>
            and also supports a manual text search mode.  
        </p>
        <p>The keyword search ingest module extracts text from the files on the image being ingested and adds them to the index that can then be searched.</p>
        <p>
            Autopsy tries its best to extract maximum amount of text from the files being indexed.
            First, the indexing will try to extract text from supported file formats, such as pure text file format, MS Office Documents, PDF files, Email files, and many others.
            If the file is not supported by the standard text extractor, Autopsy will fallback to string extraction algorithm.
            String extraction on unknown file formats or arbitrary binary files can often still extract a good amount of text from the file, often good enough to provide additional clues.
            However, string extraction will not be able to extract text strings from binary files that have been encrypted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Autopsy ships with some built-in lists that define regular expressions and enable user to search for Phone Numbers, IP addresses, URLs and E-mail addresses.
            However, enabling some of these very general lists can produce a very large number of hits, many of them can be false-positives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once files are in the index, they can be searched quickly for specific keywords, regular expressions, 
            or using keyword search lists that can contain a mixture of keywords and regular expressions.
            Search queries can be executed automatically by the ingest during the ingest run, or at the end of the ingest, depending on the current settings and the time it takes to ingest the image.
        </p>
        <p>Search queries can also be executed manually by the user at any time, as long as there are some files already indexed and ready to be searched.</p>
        <p>
            Keyword search module will save the search results regardless whether the search is performed by the ingest process, or manually by the user.
            The saved results are available in the Directory Tree in the left hand side panel.
        </p>
        <p>
            To see keyword search results in real-time while ingest is running, add keyword lists using the
            <a href="nbdocs:/org/sleuthkit/autopsy/keywordsearch/docs/keywordsearch-configuration.html">Keyword Search Configuration Dialog</a>
            and select the "Use during ingest" check box. 
            You can select "Enable sending messages to inbox during ingest" per list, if the hits on that list should be reported in the Inbox, which is recommended for very specific searches.
        </p>
        <p>
            See <a href="nbdocs:/org/sleuthkit/autopsy/ingest/docs/ingest-about.html">(Ingest)</a>
            for more information on ingest in general.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once there are files in the index, the <a href="nbdocs:/org/sleuthkit/autopsy/keywordsearch/docs/keywordsearch-bar.html">Keyword Search Bar</a>
            will be available for use to manually search at any time.
        </p>

    Tip: to create a link which will open in an external web browser, try:
    <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/">
        <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://www.netbeans.org/</u></html>">
        <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
        <param name="textColor" value="blue">
    </object>
    To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:
    <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a>
    (This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)

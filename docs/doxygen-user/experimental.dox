\section exp_overview Overview

The Experimental module, as the name implies, contains code that is not yet part of the official Autopsy release. These experimental features can be used but may be less polished than other features and will have less documentation. These modules may be changed at any time. 

\section exp_setup Enabling the Experimental Module

To start, go to Tools->Plugins and select the "Installed" tab, then check the box next to "Experimental" and click "Activate" and go through the next couple of screens. A restart should not be required.

/*! \page content_viewer_page Content Viewer

The Content Viewer lives in the lower right-hand side of the Autopsy main screen and show pictures, video, hex, text, extracted strings, metadata, etc. They are enabled when you select a file in the file list above it.

The Content Viewer is context-aware, meaning it will present different views of the content based on the type of file selected. For example, a .JPG would show up as a picture, a text file would show up as text, and a .bin file would show up as hex output.

The screenshots below show some examples of content viewers in action.

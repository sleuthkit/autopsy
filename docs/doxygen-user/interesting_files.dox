What Does It Do
========

The Interesting Files module allows you to search for files or directories in a data source and generate alerts when they are found.  You configure rules for the files that you want to find. 

You would use this to be notified when certain things are found. There are examples below that generate alerts when VMWare images are found or when iPhone backup files are found.  This module is useful for file types that will frequently have a consistent name and that may not be part of the standard checklist that you look for, or if you simply want to automate your checklist. 

Configuration
=======

Add rules using "Tools", "Options", "Interesting Files".

All rules need to be part of a set. Sets need to have the following defined:

- Set Name (required)
- Set Description (optional)

Rules specify what to look for in a data source.  Each rule specifies:
- Type: If the rule should be applied to only files, only directories, or both files and directories. 
- Name Pattern: String to match the file name against.
- Name Pattern Type: Should the pattern be matched against the full file type or just the extension. 
- Path Pattern: A substring of the parent path that must be matched. This allows you to restrict generic names to a specific structure (such as an application name).   A substring match is performed. 
- Rule Name: Additional details that are displayed in the UI when that rule is matched.  Allows you to determine which rule in the set matched.

VMWare Example
--------
This set of rules is to detect VMWare Player or vmdk files.  This would help to make sure you look into the virtual machines for additional evidence. 

NOTE: This is not extensive and is simply a minimal example:


- Set Name: VMWare
- Rule 1: 
 - Type: Files
 - Full Name: vmplayer.exe
 - Name: Program EXE
- Rule 2:
 - Type: Files
 - Extension: vmdk
 - Name: VMDK File

iPhone Backups Example
-------------
This set of rules is to detect a folder for iPhone Backups.  These are typically in a folder such as "%AppData%\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup" on Windows. Here is a rule that you could use for that.

- Set Name: iPhone Backups
- Rule 1:
 - Type: Directory
 - Name: Backup
 - Path: Apple Computer/MobileSync


Using the Module
======

When you enable the Interesting Files module, you can choose what rule sets to enable.  To add rules, use the "Advanced" button from the ingest module panel. 

When files are found, they will be in the Interesting Files area of the tree.  You shoudl see the set and rule names with the match.

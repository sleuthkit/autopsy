What Does It Do
========

Extension Mismatch Detector module uses the results from the File Type Identification and flags files that have an extension not traditionally associated with the file's detected type. Ignores 'known' (NSRL) files. You can customize the MIME types and file extensions per MIME type in Tools, Options, File Extension Mismatch.

This detects files that someone may be trying to hide.

Configuration

One can add and remove MIME types in the "Tools", "Options", "File Extension Mismatch" dialog box, as well as add and remove extensions to particular MIME types.

\section reporting_overview Overview

The report modules allow the user to extract key information from a case in a variety of formats. This includes
making an HTML or Excel report containing all the extracted content, keyword hits, etc. from a case, or creating a KML file out
of any coordinates found to load into software like Google Earth.

Most report types will allow you to select which data sources to include in the report. Note that the names of excluded data sources may still be present in the report. For example, the \ref report_html will list all data sources in the case on the main page but will not contain results, tagged files, etc. from the excluded data source(s).

The different types of reports will be described below. The majority of the report modules will generate a report file which
will be displayed in the case under the "Reports" node of the \ref tree_viewer_page.

If the report type has an associated viewer (such as a web browser for an HTML report), you can double-click the report to open it 
in an external application. Alternately you can browse to the "Reports" folder in the case folder and open the report from there.

\section report_types Report Types

\subsection report_html HTML Report

For HTML reports, you can first choose to enter a header and footer that will be displayed in your results. For example, you might want to add a classification banner.

There are two options when generating a report - include all results or only include tagged results.

If you choose "All Results", you can then optionally use the "Data Types" button to choose which types of data to include in the report.

If you choose "Tagged Results", you can restrict the files and results that appear in the report to only those tagged with the tags you select. 
Note that you can't filter on data type when using this option.

The completed report will look similar to this:

You can use the links on the left side to see the results for each data type.

\subsection report_excel Excel Report

Generating an Excel report is very similar to an \ref report_html. You select which tags or data types to export and Autopsy will create a .xlsx file.

\subsection report_tagged_hashes Add Tagged Hashes

This is one of the report modules that doesn't generate an actual report. The purpose of this module is to easily add the hashes
of some/all tagged files to an Autopsy hash set that can be used by the \ref hash_db_page. You can use the "Configure Hash Sets" button to create a new
hash set to write to, or use an existing hash set.

\image html reports_hashes_config.png

After running this module, if you use the same hash set on future cases then everything that was tagged with one of the selected tags in this case will
show up as Hashset Hits.

\subsection report_case_uco CASE-UCO

This module creates a JSON output file in <a href="https://github.com/ucoProject/CASE/wiki">CASE-UCO</a> format for a single data source.

\subsection report_files Files - Text

This report module allows you create a tab or comma delimited text file report of all of the files in the current case. Start by selecting which delimiter you would like to use.

\image html reports_files_delimiter.png

You can then select which fields should be reported.

\subsection report_kml Google Earth KML

This report module generates a KML file from any GPS data in the case. This file can then be used with Google Earth.

\subsection report_portable_case Portable Case

This report module generates a new Autopsy case that includes tagged and/or interesting items. See the \ref portable_case_page page for additional information.

\subsection report_stix STIX

The STIX module allows you to generate a report and Interesting File artifacts by running a STIX file (or files) against the data sources in the case.
For more information see the \ref stix_page page.

\subsection report_body_file TSK Body File

This module generates a <a href="https://wiki.sleuthkit.org/index.php?title=Body_file">TSK Body File</a> from the files in your case, which looks similar to the following:

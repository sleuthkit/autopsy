/*! \page module_install_page Installing 3rd-Party Modules

There are various places in Autopsy that developers can write custom plug-in modules. This page covers how to install them.  

There are two types of modules:
- Modules written in Java that are shipped in NBM (NetBeans Module) files.
- Modules written in Python that are shipped as a folder in a ZIP file.

\section module_install_nbm Installing NetBeans Modules
If you have an NBM file, then it may contain one or more Autopsy modules. To install it, use the plugin manager at "Tools", "Plugins". 

Choose the "Downloaded" tab and then choose "Add Plugins".  Browse to the NBM file.  It may require you to restart Autopsy. 

\section module_install_python Installing Python Modules
If you have a ZIP file with a Python module in it, then unzip the file and you should get a folder.  Open the Python module library folder using "Tools", "Python Plugins".  Copy the module folder into there and Autopsy should identify and use it next time it loads modules.

You need to create a case before you can analyze data in Autopsy.  A case can contain one or more data sources (disk images, disk devices, logical files). The data sources can be from multiple drives in a single computer or from multiple computers.  It's up to you. 

Each case has its own directory that is named based on the case name. The directory will contain configuration files, a database, reports, and other files that modules generates. The main Autopsy case configuration file has an ".aut" extension. 

\section case_create Creating a Case

There are several ways to create a new case:
- The opening splash screen has a button to create a new case.
- The "File", "New Case..." menu item

The "New Case" wizard dialog will open and you will need to enter the case name and base directory. A directory for the case will be created inside of the "base directory". If the directory already exists, you will need to either delete the existing directory or choose a different combination of names.

You will also be prompted for optional information, such as investigator name and case number.  

After you create the case, you will be prompted to add a data source, as described in \ref ds_add. 

\section case_open Opening a Case

To open a case, either:
- Choose "Open Case" or "Open Recent Case" from the opening splash screen.
- The "File", "Open Case" menu item or "File", "Open Recent Case"

Navigate to the case directory and select the ".aut" file.

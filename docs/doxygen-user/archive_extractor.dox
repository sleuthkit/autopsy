\section embedded_files_overview What Does It Do


The Embedded File Extractor module opens ZIP, RAR, other archive formats, Doc, Docx, PPT, PPTX, XLS, and XLSX and sends the derived files from those files back through the ingest pipeline for analysis.

This module expands archive files to enable Autopsy to analyze all files on the system. It enables keyword search and hash lookup to analyze files inside of archives

NOTE: Certain media content embedded inside Doc, Docx, PPT, PPTX, XLS, and XLSX might not be extracted.

\section embedded_files_config Configuration

There is no configuration required.

\section embedded_files_usage Using the Module

\subsection embedded_files_encryption Encrypted Archives

When the Embedded File Extractor module encounters an encrypted archive, it will generate a warning bubble in the bottom right of the main screen:

After ingest, you can attempt to decrypt these archives if you know the password. Find the archive (either in the \ref tree_viewer_page "tree view" or \ref result_viewer_page "result view") and right-click on it, then select "Unzip contents with password".

After entering the password, you can select which ingest modules to run on the newly extracted files. When finished, you can browse to the encrypted archive in the tree view to see the newly extracted files. If the archive was already open in the tree, you may have to close and open the case in order to see the new data.

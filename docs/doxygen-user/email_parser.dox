What Does It Do
========

The Email Parser module identifies MBOX, EML and PST format files based on file signatures, extracting the e-mails from them, adding the results to the Blackboard. This module skips known files and creates a Blackboard artifact for each message. It adds email attachments as derived files.

This allows the user to identify email-based communications from the system being analyzed.

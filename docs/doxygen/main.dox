/*! \mainpage Autopsy Forensic Browser Developer's Guide and API Reference

<h3>Overview</h3>
Autopsy has been designed as a platform for open source tools besides just The Sleuth Kit.  This document is for developers who want to add functionality into Autopsy.  This could be in the form of enhancing the existing functionality or by making a plug-in module.  Plug-in modules can be distributed from your own website (or contributed back).

If you are looking for documentation on using Autopsy, refer to http://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/user-docs/.

If these pages don't answer your question, then send the question to The Sleuth Kit Developer's List (https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sleuthkit-developers). 

If you want to write modules, then these pages are for you:
- \subpage platform_page
- Setup
 - \subpage mod_dev_page
 - \subpage mod_dev_py_page
- The following are based on specific types of modules:
 - \subpage mod_ingest_page
 - \subpage mod_report_page
 - \subpage mod_content_page
 - \subpage mod_result_page
- \subpage adv_dev_page
- \subpage mod_mobile_page

These pages are more detailed if you want to modify Autopsy code instead of writing add-on modules. 
- \subpage workflow_page
- \subpage regression_test_page 
- \subpage native_page

<!-- Note that Case still has lots of content in package.dox -->

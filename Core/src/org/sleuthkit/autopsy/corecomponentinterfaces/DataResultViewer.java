/**
 * An interface for result viewers. A result viewer uses a Swing Component to
 * provide a view of the application data represented by a NetBeans Node passed
 * to it via its setNode method.
 *
 * Result viewers are most commonly presented as a tab in a result view panel
 * (DataResultPanel) inside a result view top component (DataResultTopComponent)
 * that is docked into the upper right hand side (editor mode) of the main
 * application window.
 *
 * A result viewer is typically a JPanel that displays the child nodes of the
 * given node using a NetBeans explorer view child component. Such a result
 * viewer should use the explorer manager of the ancestor top component to
 * connect the lookups of the nodes displayed in the NetBeans explorer view to
 * the actions global context. It is strongly recommended that this type of
 * result viewer is implemented by extending the abstract base class
 * AbstractDataResultViewer, which will handle some key aspects of working with
 * the ancestor top component's explorer manager.
 *
 * This interface is an extension point, so classes that implement it should
 * provide an appropriate ServiceProvider annotation.

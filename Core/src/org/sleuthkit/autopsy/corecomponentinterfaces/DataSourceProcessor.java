 * Data source processors plug in to the add data source wizard and should
 * provide a UI panel to allow a user to select a data source and do any

 * events to communicate with the wizard.
 *
 * Data source processors should perform all processing in a background task in
 * a separate thread, reporting results using a callback object.

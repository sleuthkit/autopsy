        <h2>Hex Content Viewer</h2>
        <p>
            Hex Content Viewer shows you the raw and exact contents of a file. 
            In this Hex Content Viewer, the data of the file is represented as hexadecimal values grouped in 2 groups of 8 bytes,
            followed by one group of 16 ASCII characters which are derived from each pair of hex values (each byte).
            Non-printable ASCII characters and characters that would take more than one character space are typically represented by a dot (".") in the following ASCII field.

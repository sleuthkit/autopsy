        <h2>String Content Viewer</h2>
        <p>
            Strings Content Viewer scans (potentially binary) data of the file / folder and searches it for data that could be text. 
            When appropriate data is found, the String Content Viewer shows data strings extracted from binary, decoded, and interpreted as UTF8/16 for the selected script/language.
        </p>
	    <p>
            Note that this is different from the Text Content Viewer, which displays the text for a file that is stored in the keyword search index. 
            The results may be the same or they could be different, depending how the data were interpreted by the indexer.
        </p>

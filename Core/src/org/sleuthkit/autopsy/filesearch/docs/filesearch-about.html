        <h2>About File Search</h2>
        <p>
            File Search tool can be accessed either from the Tools menu or by right-clicking on image node in the Data Explorer / Directory Tree.
            By using File Search, you can specify, filter, and show the directories and files that you want to see from the images in the current opened case.
            The File Search results will be populated in a brand new Table Result viewer on the right-hand side.
        </p>
        <p>Currently, Autopsy only supports 4 categories in File Search: Name, Size, Date, and Known Status based search.</p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li><strong>Note:</strong>
                Currently File Search doesn't support regular expression,
                however the Keyword Search feature of Autopsy does also look in file names and it does support regular expressions,
                which can complimentary to the File Search.
            </li>
        </ul>

    Tip: to create a link which will open in an external web browser, try:
    <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/">
        <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://www.netbeans.org/</u></html>">
        <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
        <param name="textColor" value="blue">
    </object>
    To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:
    <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a>
    (This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)

        <h2>How to Open File Search</h2>
        <p>To open the File Search, you can do one of the following thing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right click an image and choose "Open File Search by Attributes".
                <br>
                <img src="open_fileSearch1.png" alt="Open File Search Top Component 1" />
            </li>
            <li>Select the "Tools" > "File Search by Attributes".
                <br>
                <img src="open_fileSearch2.png" alt="Open File Search Top Component 2" />
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="note">
            <li><strong>Note:</strong>
                The File Search Window is opened and closed automatically.
                If there's a case opened and there is at least one image inside that case, File Search Window can't be closed.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Autopsy allows you to conduct a digital forensic investigation.  
            It is a graphical interface to The Sleuth Kit and other tools.
            This page outlines the basic concepts of the program. 
            The remainder of the help guide is organized around these concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main Autopsy features include: importing and image and exploring its file systems,
            running analysis modules (ingest), viewing ingest results, viewing content and generating reports.
        </p>
        <p>
            Autopsy is an extensible application; it provides a plug-in framework that allows other other parties to supply plug-ins and supply additional: 
            image and file ingest for new types of analysis, different content viewers and different types of reports to be supported.
            There are plug-ins for for several ingest modules, viewers and reports that are bundled by default with Autopsy.
        </p>
        <p>
            All data is organized around the concept of a <a href="nbdocs:/org/sleuthkit/autopsy/casemodule/docs/casemodule-about.html">case</a>.  
            A case can have one or more disk <a href="nbdocs:/org/sleuthkit/autopsy/casemodule/docs/aboutImage.html">images</a> loaded into it.
        </p>
        <p>The main window has three major areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="nbdocs:/org/sleuthkit/autopsy/corecomponents/docs/dataexplorer-about.html">Data Explorer Tree</a>:
                This area is where you go find major analysis functionality.
                It allows you to start finding the relevant files quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="nbdocs:/org/sleuthkit/autopsy/corecomponents/docs/dataresult-about.html">Result Viewers</a>:
                This area is where the files and directories that were found from the explorer window can be viewed.
                There are different formatting options for the files.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="nbdocs:/org/sleuthkit/autopsy/corecomponents/docs/datacontent-about.html">Content Viewers</a>:
                This area is where file content can be viewed after they are selected from the Result Viewer area.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The main take away from this should be that analysis techniques and result categories can be found on the left-hand side,
            the results from choosing something on the left are always listed in the upper right,
            and the file contents are displayed in the lower left.
        </p>

    Tip: to create a link which will open in an external web browser, try:
    <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/">
        <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://www.netbeans.org/</u></html>">
        <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
        <param name="textColor" value="blue">
    </object>
    To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:
    <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a>
    (This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)

        <h2>Ingest Message Inbox</h2>
            <p>
                The ingest message inbox is used by Autopsy to provide real-time updates during ingest.
                To open the inbox, click on the yellow warning sign in the top/right corner of the Autopsy window.
                The sign can display a number of incoming unread (not yet clicked) messages during ingest in its upper-right corner.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Ingest modules are able to post messages when notable events occur, 
                such as a keyword or hash database hit.
                If a module posts many similar messages in a short time span,
                the inbox will group those messages so that unique updates are not lost among the noise.
            </p>
            <p>
                The grouped messages are colored with different shades to indicate their importance; if a message group contains a lower number of unique messages, it is
                potentially more important than another group with a large number of unique messages.  The more unique important messages have a lighter background color.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ingest messages can be sorted by uniqueness/importance, or by chronological order in which they had appeared.
            </p>
            <p>
                A message can be clicked to view the message details.  When a message is clicked, it is marked as "read".
                When updates are posted with regard to a specific result or file, the message is linked to that file
                and the buttons in the top/right corner of the message details view can be used to browse to that data.

        <h2>Ingest Message Inbox</h2>
        <p>
            The ingest message inbox is used by Autopsy to provide real-time updates during ingest.
            To open the inbox, click on the yellow warning sign in the top/right corner of the Autopsy window.
            The sign can display a number of incoming unread (not yet clicked) messages during ingest in its upper-right corner.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ingest modules are able to post messages when notable events occur, 
            such as a keyword or hash database hit.
            If a module posts many similar messages in a short time span,
            the inbox will group those messages so that unique updates are not lost among the noise.
        </p>
        <p>
            The grouped messages are colored with different shades to indicate their importance;
            if a message group contains a lower number of unique messages,
            it is potentially more important than another group with a large number of unique messages. 
            The more unique important messages have a lighter background color.
        </p>
        <p>The ingest messages can be sorted by uniqueness/importance, or by chronological order in which they had appeared.</p>
        <p>
            A message can be clicked to view the message details.  When a message is clicked, it is marked as "read".
            When updates are posted with regard to a specific result or file, the message is linked to that file
            and the buttons in the top/right corner of the message details view can be used to browse to that data.

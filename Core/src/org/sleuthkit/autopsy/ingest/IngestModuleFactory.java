/**
 * An interface that must be implemented by all providers of Autopsy ingest
 * modules. An ingest module factory is used to create instances of a type of
 * data source ingest module, a type of file ingest module, or both.
 * <p>
 * Autopsy will generally use the factory to create several instances of each
 * type of module for each ingest job it performs. Completing an ingest job
 * entails processing a single data source (e.g., a disk image) and all of the
 * files from the data source, including files extracted from archives and any
 * unallocated space (made to look like a series of files). The data source is
 * passed through one or more pipelines of data source ingest modules. The files
 * are passed through one or more pipelines of file ingest modules.
 * <p>
 * Autopsy may use multiple threads to complete an ingest job, but it is
 * guaranteed that there will be no more than one module instance per thread.
 * However, if the module instances must share resources, the modules are
 * responsible for synchronizing access to the shared resources and doing
 * reference counting as required to release those resources correctly. Also,
 * more than one ingest job may be in progress at any given time. This must also
 * be taken into consideration when sharing resources between module instances.
 * <p>
 * An ingest module factory may provide global and per ingest job settings user
 * interface panels. The global settings should apply to all module instances.
 * The per ingest job settings should apply to all module instances working on a
 * particular ingest job. Autopsy supports context-sensitive and persistent per
 * ingest job settings, so per ingest job settings must be serializable.
 * <p>
 * To be discovered at runtime by the ingest framework, IngestModuleFactory
 * implementations must be marked with the following NetBeans Service provider
 * annotation:
 *
 * <pre>\@ServiceProvider(service=IngestModuleFactory.class)</pre>
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT TIP: If an implementation of IngestModuleFactory does not need to
 * provide implementations of all of the IngestModuleFactory methods, it can
 * extend the abstract class IngestModuleFactoryAdapter to get default
 * implementations of most of the IngestModuleFactory methods.

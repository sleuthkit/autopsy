/**
 * Event data that are fired off by ingest modules when they have posted new
 * data of specific type to the blackboard. The name of property change fired is
 * then IngestManager.IngestModuleEvent.DATA.toString()
 *
 * In its most generic form, it only gives notice about a type of artifact and
 * it can also give notice about specific IDs that can be retrieved.
 *
 * The object wraps a collection of blackboard artifacts and their associated
 * attributes that are to be reported as the new data to listeners. Passing the
 * data as part of the event reduces memory footprint and decreases number of
 * garbage collections of the blackboard artifacts and attributes objects (the
 * objects are expected to be reused by the data event listeners).
 *
 * If a module does not pass the data as part of ModuleDataEvent
 * (ModuleDataEvent.getArtifacts() returns null) - it is an indication that the
 * module has new data but it does not implement new data tracking. The listener
 * can then perform a blackboard query to get the latest data of interest (e.g.
 * by artifact type).
 *
 * By design, only a single type of artifacts can be contained in a single data
 * event.

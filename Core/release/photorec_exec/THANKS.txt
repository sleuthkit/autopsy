TestDisk & PhotoRec are mainly written by Christophe GRENIER.
Many people further contributed to TestDisk, directly or indirectly, by
reporting problems, helping with the documentation, suggesting various
improvements, sending me gifts using my Amazon whish-list...

Thanks to the thousands of people who have provided support for the project!
